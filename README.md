# Exploration of Linear Systems on Graphs

This notebook contains my experimentation with linear systems on graphs.
You can open a static snapshot of the notebook on the following page: 
<https://mattdupraz.github.io/Graph-Linear-Systems/>

Note that you will not be able to interact with the notebook in the above
page, and it might not correspond to the most recent commits in this repository.

To see the up-to-date code in action it is
best to open the notebook using Pluto.
To do so, you will need to install Julia (I am running v1.10.2
at the time of writing this).
Open the Julia REPL in the repository folder and
type `]add Pluto`. this should install the latest
version of Pluto. Then press backspace
and run Pluto with `using Pluto` and `Pluto.run()`.
This should open Pluto in your browser, from where you should be able to
see and open the notebook.

You can also try to open the notebook in Binder: [external link](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.36/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252FMattDupraz%252FGraph-Linear-Systems%252Fmain%252Fgraphs.jl)

However, from my trials Binder seems very slow,
so it is encouraged to run the notebook locally.
