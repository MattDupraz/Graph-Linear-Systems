# Exploration of Linear Systems on Graphs

The Pluto notebook contains my experimentation with linear systems on graphs.
You can open a static snapshot of the notebook on the following page: 
<https://mattdupraz.github.io/Graph-Linear-Systems/>

To be able to interact with the notebook, you have to select "Edit or run this
notebook" after loading the above link. From there you can launch the notebook in the
cloud using Binder. However, the notebook will take a few minutes to download
and pre-compile all the required libraries, so I would recommend cloning the
repository on your machine and run Pluto locally.

To do so, you will need to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
(I am running v1.10.2 at the time of writing this).
After installing, open the Julia REPL in the repository folder and download
Pluto by typing `]add Pluto`. Then press backspace
and run Pluto with `using Pluto` and `Pluto.run()`.
This should open Pluto in your browser, from where you will be able to open the notebook.
