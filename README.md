# Exploration of Linear Systems on Graphs

This notebook contains my experimentation with linear systems on graphs.
The file is readable as is, but to see the code in action it is
best to open the notebook using Pluto.

To run the notebook you will need to install Julia (I am running v1.10.2
at the time of writing this).
Open the Julia REPL in the repository folder and
type `]add Pluto`. this should install the latest
version of Pluto. Then press backspace
and run Pluto with `using Pluto` and `Pluto.run()`.
This should open Pluto in your browser, from where you should be able to
see and open the notebook.

You can also open the notebook in Binder: [external link](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.36/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252FMattDupraz%252FGraph-Linear-Systems%252Fmain%252Fgraphs.jl)

From my trials Binder seems very slow, so it is encouraged to run the notebook locally.
